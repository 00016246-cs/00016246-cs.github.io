The current project tried to recreate the website design of HIlton Honors (https://www.hilton.com/en/) by adding some changes to the original website's look. The website's main color was chosen to be green to make it as good but not the exact as Hilton's web page.

This project consists of five separate HTML pages. These include the Home Page, the Join in, sign in, Offers, and About us page. Each page, although has some similarities at some places, has a completely unique structure. The Home page includes references to all the other pages. And it is also possible to go back to the Home page from other pages via various methods. It was achieved utilizing different ways, such as using eventListenener with JS script or having links to the main page. For example, the Sign in page a X button on top right corner which leads the user back to the main page.

There is a common css for all the pages but each page has its own style tag with its own styles as well. 

This project attempted to recreate Hilton's website minimalistically for coursework purpouses and it was created to fulfill Web Technology 
moduleâ€™s requirements and does not represent an actual company or service.
